His next class is art. He draws on paper with crayons and pencils and sometimes uses a ruler. Lucas likes art. 
It is his favorite class.

His third class is science. This class is very hard for Lucas to figure out, but he gets to work with his 
classmates a lot, which he likes to do. His friend, Kyle, works with Lucas in science class, and they have fun.
