Compare and Contrast Paragraph

Oceans and lakes have much in common, but they are also quite different. Both are bodies of water, but oceans 
are very large bodies of salt water, while lakes are much smaller bodies of fresh water. Lakes are usually
surrounded by land, while oceans are what surround continents. Both have plants and animals living in them.
The ocean is home to the largest animals on the planet, whereas lakes support much smaller forms of life.
When it is time for a vacation, both will make a great place to visit and enjoy.

Critical Paragraph

The Blue Whales just played their first baseball game of the new season; I believe there is much to be excited
about. Although they lost, it was against an excellent team that had won the championship last year. The Blue
Whales fell behind early but showed excellent teamwork and came back to tie the game. The team had 15 hits and
scored 8 runs. That's excellent! Unfortunately, they had 5 fielding errors, which kept the other team in the 
lead the entire game. The game ended with the umpire making a bad call, and if the call had gone the other way,
the Blue Whales might have actually won the game. It wasn't a victory, but I say the Blue Whales look like they
have a shot at the championship, especially if they continue to improve.
