This example is when you run into someone. This is an easy type of small talk because when you run out of 
things to say, you can always say bye. There are times when you don't have that option. Let's practice a 
situation where you cannot leave, such as an interview. I go into depth about interview communication in a 
different section. For now, I am going to emphasize the small talk portion of an interview.

"Hi Mary."

"Oh, hi."
@
"How are you doing?"
@
"I'm doing alright. How about you?"
@
"Not too bad. The weather is great isn't it?"
@
"Yes. It's absolutely beautiful today."
@
"I wish it was like this more frequently."
@
"Me too."

This is a good example of small talk. It shows that you are easy to speak with, and most importantly, you 
found a small connection even though it was about a small topic such as the traffic problem. In this type of 
situation, don't feel that you have to constantly talk. If it is not relevant to the topic, it might be better 
not to say anything. But if you can add on to the topic, it's a good thing. The person who is giving the 
interview has the control, and that person will direct the small talk to the interview when the time is right.
