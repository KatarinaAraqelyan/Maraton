Following a consistent programming style often helps readability. However, readability is more than just 
programming style. Many factors, having little or nothing to do with the ability of the computer to 
efficiently compile and execute the code, contribute to readability. Some of these factors include:
@
1)Different indent styles (whitespace)
@
2)Comments
@
3)Decomposition
@
4)Naming conventions for objects (such as variables, classes, procedures, etc.)

The presentation aspects of this (such as indents, line breaks, color highlighting, and so on) are often 
handled by the source code editor, but the content aspects reflect the programmer's talent and skills.
